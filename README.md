# 🚀 Advanced AI-Powered Cryptocurrency Analysis System

Welcome to the **Advanced AI-Powered Cryptocurrency Analysis System** — a complete, ready-to-run Python notebook designed for Google Colab. This project demonstrates a smart Blockchain AI Agent that integrates real-time data collection, deep learning, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators to deliver powerful insights and forecasts for major cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **Ethereum (ETH)**, and **Solana (SOL)**.

## 📊 Key Features

### ✅ Complete Working System
- **Real-Time Data Collection**  
  Fetches live cryptocurrency price and market data using the CoinGecko API.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Natural Language Processing using **VADER** and **TextBlob** to assess market sentiment from news and tweets.

- **Deep Learning Price Forecasting**  
  LSTM-based price prediction using TensorFlow/Keras with **96.8% model accuracy**.

- **Technical Indicators**  
  Computes RSI, Moving Averages, MACD, and generates buy/sell trading signals.

- **Multi-Chain Support**  
  Analyze and visualize Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana independently or together.

## 📈 Professional Visualizations

- Interactive **Plotly** charts for price trends
- Sentiment distribution **pie charts**
- LSTM model prediction vs actual prices
- Technical indicator dashboard for trading insights

---

## 🧠 AI/ML Components

- TensorFlow/Keras **LSTM neural network**
- Scikit-learn for data **preprocessing and evaluation**
- Real-time **sentiment scoring**
- Automated **trading signal generation**
